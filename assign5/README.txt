This is assign five

* Create a web app that shows some simple server-side scripting, perhaps two buttons or forms where one calls a function on the server that writes something to a file and another that retrieves that text

  I used flask. To run you must "pip install flask" if you haven't downloaded flask before, run the app.py in IDE/terminal, then in a url type in "localhost:5000" to visit the website

* Go find some plugin, module, or whatever your server-side environment uses to enhance its framework and create a website that shows off that module

  I used express. Run the code "server.js" inside the folder express, then in a url type in "localhost:3000" to visit the website
